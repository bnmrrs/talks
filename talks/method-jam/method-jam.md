We design and build software.

^
- We design and build web and mobile applications
- We're young, we founded the company 1.5 years ago, 15 people
- Little clients to big clients
- Our model is a little bit different
- Because we think...

### [fit] The traditional agency model is broken

![](http://i.imgur.com/c2bLO9h.jpg)

^ By traditional I mean...
- Fixed price sucks
- Hourly sucks
- So, why is it broken?...

---

# Agency model is broken
Incentives are aren't aligned.

![](http://i.imgur.com/c2bLO9h.jpg)

^ 
Big part of it Incentives aren't aligned
- Fixed price - as soon as we sign the contract I'm incentivized to end the project, we fight, I get paid the same, change control
- Hourly - I'm not invested enough in the project, unit is too small

---

### [fit] How we fix it.

![](http://i.imgur.com/dULQhlA.jpg)

^ So, how do we fix it? 
- How do we bring incentives in line?
- How do our clients win when we win?
- How do we win when our clients win?

---

### [fit] Lean/Agile
![](http://i.imgur.com/cAgjn7Q.jpg)

^ Use a pair of frameworks
- Lean - lean manufacturing, 1950s toyota, eliminate waste, anything that doesn't contribute to customer value is considered waste.
- Agile - software dev methodology
Values: adaptive planning, iterative, responding to change

---

### [fit] Align incentives

![](http://www.cangrade.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Donks_Carrots-785x400.jpg)

^ 
- Make sure everybody is incentivized to make the project win
- Collective ownership

---

# Align incentives
Work with, not for.

![](http://www.cangrade.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Donks_Carrots-785x400.jpg)

^ Be a partner/trusted confidant
- Everything is broken, it's okay, it's the normal state of things
- We've been there
- We're from product companies

---
# Align incentives
Plan. Work. Demo. Repeat. - One Week

![](http://www.cangrade.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Donks_Carrots-785x400.jpg)

^ 
Our smallest billable unit: 1 week
Explain a sprint
- Weekly iteration
- Plan, Work, Demo, Repeat
- What you want now isn't what you want 6 months from now

---

### [fit] Drive projects with budgets, not estimates

![](http://i.imgur.com/KupYvwz.jpg)

^ This is a great blog post by DHH, creator of rails
Look it up on their blog signal vs noise
- Typically a client comes in and says "I'd like this. How long will that take?"
- We all suck at answering that. Instead set the scope by asking... 

---

# Budgets, not estimates
How much would you like to spend?

![](http://i.imgur.com/KupYvwz.jpg)

^
- It can be tough to ask and get a good answer
- It will cost exactly that much
- We can do anything in a week, the trade off is...

---

# Budgets, not estimates
Width vs Depth vs Time.

![](http://i.imgur.com/KupYvwz.jpg)

^ Width vs Depth vs Time
- Set time/cost first
- Then make tradeoffs for feature width/depth
- Diminishing returns on polish
- Often 80% of a feature for 20% of the effort
One 100% feature or five 80% features


---

### [fit] Work iteratively

![](http://i.imgur.com/cIYLafI.jpg)

^ Related to the one week sprints we talked about earlier

---

# Work iteratively
Steer the boat

![](http://i.imgur.com/cIYLafI.jpg)

^ Always steer the boat
- Changing your mind should be encouraged
- Optimize for getting started
- Google launch your product 3 weeks into a design?
- Talking to customers changes your mind?
- Just reorder the next sprint

---

# Work iteratively
Call "good enough" at any time.

![](http://i.imgur.com/cIYLafI.jpg)

^ What is good enough?
- Call it when you get to the diminishing returns point
- Good enough to show customers?

---

### [fit] Challenges

![](http://i.imgur.com/rOloO5x.jpg)

^ Of course it isn't always easy

---

# Challenges
We can't answer "How long and how much?"

![](http://i.imgur.com/rOloO5x.jpg)

^ NEXT SLIDE

# Challenges
We can't answer "How long and how much?"
We'd be lying if we did.

![](http://i.imgur.com/rOloO5x.jpg)

^ You want to know what to budget and how to reduce risk
We solve it with:
- Fixed amount per week, budget-able 
- Spec an amount of time and work within it
- Works well if you can but everything comes down to...


---

# Challenges
Trust.

![](http://i.imgur.com/rOloO5x.jpg)

^ Everything comes down to trust
- If you trust us to do a good job then nothing else really matters
- All other structure is just intended to reduce risk
- Want to reduce risk? Let's get started with a prototype and you can leave if you'd like

^ 
- We're in this together, your success is our success
- Width vs Depth vs Time
- Iterate Iterate Iterate Always steer
- Reserve the right to be smarter later
